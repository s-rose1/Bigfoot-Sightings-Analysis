## **Introduction**

Anecdotal claims of Bigfoot sightings have intrigued Americans for over a century. This Tableau Dashboard is the result of my analysis of Bigfoot sighting data spanning back to the early 1900s, sourced from the Bigfoot Field Research Organization. The dashboard explores correlations between sighting patterns, time, season, cloud cover, state population, and tree coverage. These insights shed light on the phenomenon and provide supporting evidence for a popular theory.

### Dataset:  
Data was obtained from the Bigfoot Field Research Organiziation along with Urban Tree Canopy Data from Urban and Community Forestry in Washington State. The data includes text comments describing the sightings, dates and times, weather information, and tree coverage information. The data was cleaned to remove duplicates and nulls and data types were converted to the appropriate values.


## **Dashboard Insights**
### **Comparing Sightings with Time, Season, and Cloud Cover**
**Total Sightings by Year:** A visualization of the frequency of Bigfoot sightings over the years, showcasing a significant peak in 2004 with 241 sightings. The release of a 2003 National Geographic sensationalized article, [Forensic Expert Says Big Foot is Real](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/forensic-expert-says-bigfoot-is-real), showcases the culture of cryptids at the time. It's likely this culture is related to the uptick in reported sightings.It's likely this culture is related to the uptick in reported sightings.

The subsequent decline in sightings intrigued me. To better understand it, I decided to investigate the popular theories surrounding Big Foot. One such theory is that Big Foot sightings are simply bears being mistaken for the creature. A connection was found between decreased bear populations, possibly due to a 2018 salmon disease outbreak in the northwest, and the decline in sightings around the same period. Another possible explanation that supports the decline in sightings following the 2004 peak is smartphones and cameras becoming commonplace. Sightings became less believable as they failed to be accompanied by hard evidence such as picture and video.


**Seasonal Patterns:** An analysis of sightings by season shows that summer leads; more people are outside during warmer months. This could contribute to increased sightings by increased incidence of mistaken bear sighitngs as well. Additionally, an investigation into the influence of cloud cover on sightings reveals peaks during both clear and overcast conditions. Clear skies are associated with more outdoor activities, potentially leading to increased sightings, while cloudy skies raise the possibility of mistaken identifications due to reduced visibility

### **Location Analysis**
**Sightings per State:** Big Foot sightings were laid over the 2018 US Census State Population. Washington consistently leads in sightings, hinting at possible cultural and environmental factors influencing the phenomenon.

**Washington State:** An examination of Washington state's counties in relation to sightings and tree coverage was undertaken. As is expected, sightings are more prevalent in densely wooded areas. Of course, this doesn't prove the possibilty of Big Foot but could point to mistaken identity due to increased shade and canopy.

## Conclusion

This analysis of purported Bigfoot sightings has unveiled intriguing correlations between these sightings and several key factors, namely season, cloud cover, and tree coverage. The temporal trend in sightings, characterized by a peak in 2004 followed by an overall decline, appears to be linked to the culture of the time. The prevalence of media exposure likely played a pivotal role in shaping the observed sighting patterns. The following decline in reported sightings after 2004 can be attributed to the growing prevalence of smartphones and cameras. As more people began carrying these devices with built-in cameras, the likelihood of capturing evidence of such sightings increased, making it easier to scrutinize and potentially debunk alleged encounters with Bigfoot.


Moreover, our investigation delved into the potential influence of media on Bigfoot sighting trends, shedding light on the complex interplay between popular culture and the phenomenon of Bigfoot. Furthermore, we explored the hypothesis concerning the impact of bear population changes on these sightings, finding evidence that lends support to the bear theory.

As we conclude this analysis, it is evident that Bigfoot sightings are not solely a product of a mysterious creature lurking in the wilderness but are instead intricately intertwined with human culture, media exposure, and technological advancements. Future investigations could delve deeper into the cultural influences that drive these sightings and explore variations in eyesight and perception among different states. Such endeavors will undoubtedly contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon of Bigfoot sightings, bridging the gap between folklore, science, and society.
