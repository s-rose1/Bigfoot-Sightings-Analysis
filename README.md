# Bigfoot-Sightings-Analysis

## Introduction

Anecdotal claims of Bigfoot sightings have intrigued Americans for over a century. This Tableau Dashboard is the result of my analysis of Bigfoot sighting data spanning back to the early 1900s, sourced from the Bigfoot Field Research Organization. The dashboard explores correlations between sighting patterns, time, season, cloud cover, state population, and tree coverage. These insights shed light on the phenomenon and provide supporting evidence for a popular theory.

## Dashboard Insights

## Conclusion

Through this analysis, I've unveiled correlations between Bigfoot sightings and environmental factors such as season, cloud cover, and tree coverage. Additionally, the influence of media on sighting trends and the possible impact of bear population changes were explored, lending support to the bear theory. Further investigations could delve into cultural influences and eyesight variations among states.
