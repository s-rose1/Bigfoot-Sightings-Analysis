## **Introduction**

Anecdotal claims of Bigfoot sightings have intrigued Americans for over a century. This Tableau Dashboard is the result of my analysis of Bigfoot sighting data spanning back to the early 1900s, sourced from the Bigfoot Field Research Organization. The dashboard explores correlations between sighting patterns, time, season, cloud cover, state population, and tree coverage. These insights shed light on the phenomenon and provide supporting evidence for a popular theory.

## **Dashboard Insights**
### **Comparing Sightings with Time, Season, and Cloud Cover**
**Total Sightings by Year:** A visualization of the frequency of Bigfoot sightings over the years, showcasing a significant peak in 2004 with 241 sightings. The release of a 2003 National Geographic article, Big Foot is Real, showcases the culture of cryptids at the time. It's likely this culture is related to the uptick in reported sightings.

The subsequent decline in sightings intrigued me. To better understand it, I decided to investigate the popular theories surrounding Big Foot. One such theory is that Big Foot sightings are simply bears being mistaken for the creature. A connection was found between decreased bear populations, possibly due to a 2018 salmon disease outbreak in the northwest, and the decline in sightings around the same period.

**Seasonal Patterns:** An analysis of sightings by season shows that summer leads; more people are outside during warmer months. This could contribute to increased sightings by increased incidence of mistaken bear sighitngs as well. In addition, cloud cover's influence on sightings was explored. It revealed peaks in sightings under both clear and completely cloudy skies. Clear skies could contribute to an increased amount of people outdoors while cloudy skies lend themselves to the possiblity of mistaken sightings.

### **Location Analysis**
**Sightings per State:** Big Foot sightings were laid over the 2018 US Census State Population. Washington consistently leads in sightings, hinting at possible cultural and environmental factors influencing the phenomenon.

**Washington State:** An examination of Washington state's counties in relation to sightings and tree coverage was undertaken. Sightings are more prevalent in densely wooded areas, possibly due to increased shading and once again, mistaken identity.

## Conclusion

Through this analysis, I've unveiled correlations between Bigfoot sightings and environmental factors such as season, cloud cover, and tree coverage. Additionally, the influence of media on sighting trends and the possible impact of bear population changes were explored, lending support to the bear theory. Further investigations could delve into cultural influences and eyesight variations among states.
